    Particle Openfort Demo
  </h3>
</div>

‚ö°Ô∏è Demo application showcasing the utilization of Openfort session keys & player accounts in tandem with authentication/wallet creation through [Particle Auth](https://docs.particle.network/developers/auth-service). Specifically, this application facilitates the creation of a wallet/identity with Particle, which is then used to create an Openfort player, upon which a session key can be generated to test within a **gasless** and **popupless** NFT mint.

Built using **Particle Auth**, **Openfort**, **Typescript**, and **Ethers**.

## üîë Particle Auth
Particle Auth, a component of Particle Network's Wallet-as-a-Service, enables seamless onboarding to an application-embedded MPC-TSS/AA wallet facilitated by social login, such as Google, GitHub, email, phone number, etc.
